      <div class="timeline-date">03 feb 2025 (A Scribble Turned Memory.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event">Today was our school's Scribble Day. Everything was going normal until something a little unexpected happened. She looked at me and wrote “Jigri” on my shirt. Honestly, I didn’t really understand what it meant at first, but in return, I just wrote my name on her dress.

A little while later, she came to me and asked for a photo together. I didn’t expect it, but I said yes. And just like that, we clicked our first photo together.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="timeline-date">06 feb 2025 (Farewell, But Not The End.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event"><p>Today was our school farewell. Everything went as expected — laughter, fun, photos, memories. We all enjoyed it a lot. But as the event came to an end, emotions started to take over. Everyone was hugging each other, saying their goodbyes, and getting teary-eyed.</p>

<p>In the middle of all this, my eyes suddenly caught her. Without thinking much, I walked up to her and gave her a hug. It felt... different. I had hugged many people today, but this one just felt special. I don’t know why.</p>

<p>Later, when most of the students had left, a few of us were sitting with the principal. me and her were seated apart at first. Then, out of nowhere, she came and sat right beside me. And in that emotional silence, she held my hand. I didn’t know what was happening.
For a moment, I asked myself — Is this love? But then I told myself, no, it's nothing like that. Still, the feeling was something I can’t really explain. We’ve barely talked before, almost like strangers... and yet, that moment felt so deep and real.</p>

<p>Before leaving, we promised each other that we’d never forget this day — or each other.</p>

<p>Whatever it was... I’m glad it happened.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="timeline-date">23 Apr 2025 (Our First Date - More Than I Ever Dreamed.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event"><p>By now, me and she were officially in a relationship. Girlfriend-boyfriend. It still feels surreal sometimes</p>
<p>Today, we planned our very first date. The plan was simple — to meet near the temple around 5 PM. She parked her scooty there, and we headed off together to a place I’d never been before: the Durg-Sivnath river forest view</p>
<p>I was just hoping it would be a nice place… but honestly, nothing else mattered. She was with me, and that made everything feel perfect.
I was a little nervous — okay, maybe a lot — but she was even more nervous than me. And somehow, that made everything feel more real, more special.</p>
<p>We spent such a beautiful, romantic time there — walking together, sharing a long hug, looking into each other’s eyes, and just being present in that moment.</p>
<p>At one point, she said her legs were hurting. That was the first time I ever carried her in my arms. It felt so soft, so full of love.
After that, we left the forest and while riding back, we started talking about something... something special. She suddenly said, “Let’s go to a private place.”
</p>
<p>I didn’t overthink it. I just wanted her to feel safe and happy, so I took her to a peaceful spot. We sat, we talked. I wanted to kiss her — I had felt that from the beginning of the date, but I remembered she once told me she doesn’t want to kiss on the first date.
</p>
<p>But the way we were talking… the comfort, the trust, the closeness — it felt different now. So I gently asked, “Are you comfortable?”
</p>
<p>She didn’t speak — just nodded her head softly. And that’s how we had our first kiss.
Not one, but four lip-to-lip kisses — each one full of emotion, warmth, and a feeling I honestly can’t even describe in words.</p>
<p>Before leaving, we gave each other flowers, shared one last tight hug… and I kissed her forehead gently.
</p>
<p>That’s how our first date ended — not like in movies, but something even more beautiful: real, emotional, and unforgettable.

      <div class="timeline-date">07 May 2025 (The Look That Said It All.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event">
<p>Today, we didn’t have any plans to meet, but sometimes the best moments are the unexpected ones.</p>
<p>
Around 7:15 PM, Shona called me asking where I was. She told me she was coming to Khursipar to pick up her bro and said, “Since I’m coming, meet me too.” I replied that I was at the ground nearby and asked her to come over.</p>
<p>By 7:29, she called again and said she had arrived. I walked to meet her and she told me to hop on the back seat. I wasn’t sure how well she would manage driving, but honestly, she rode smoothly and confidently. We were headed to her bro place.</p>
<p>While I was sitting behind her, I couldn’t help but feel a strong urge to hold her tight, to give her a hug from behind… but I didn’t act on it. She was focused on driving, and I respected that moment.
After meeting her bro — who I found to be really friendly and likable — he took over the driving. I sat in the middle, and Shona sat behind me. They dropped me back at the ground.</p>
<p>Before leaving, there was a moment — the way she looked at me, it felt like she didn’t want to say goodbye just yet. Her eyes said something, even though her lips didn’t. Maybe if her bro wasn’t around, we would have shared a hug or even a kiss. But we respected the moment, smiled, and said our goodbyes.</p>

<p>
And then… she left.
</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="timeline-date">27 May 2025 (In Her Arms, I Healed.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event"><p>What happened in the last 24 hours was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on 26 May, I had an accident. It wasn’t something I saw coming, and the pain was overwhelming — both physically and emotionally. When I told Shona about it, she immediately said she wanted to meet me. She even offered to come over late at night, around 12, since she was staying at her bestie house nearby. But I refused. It was too late, and my house was full of people. The timing just wasn’t right.</p>
<p>This morning, everyone at home had made plans to go out, so suddenly the house was quiet and empty. I had an exam too, but the pain was too much — I couldn’t even think about going.</p>
<p>Shona insisted again that she wanted to meet me, and honestly, I also felt like seeing her. There was a kind of comfort I knew only her presence could give at that moment. So I said yes.</p>
<p>She called me after some time and said she had arrived near my house. I guided her on the phone, and soon enough, she was at my door.</p>
<p>The moment she entered, she gave me the warmest hug. I was lying on my bed, feeling low — physically and mentally — and she just sat beside me and held me gently. She cradled my head in her lap, ran her fingers softly through my hair, and everything around me felt calm.</p>
<p>There was a deep emotional connection between us. 
</p>
<p>As we talked and spent time, we shared a few gentle kisses. I held her close, resting my head on her. There was love in the way she looked at me, the way she allowed me to express myself freely. She trusted me — and I trusted her.</p>
<p>We respected each other’s boundaries, even in the deepest moments of closeness. And in that, I felt something far beyond attraction — I felt safe. Cared for. Loved.</p>
<p>
Before leaving, she hugged me tight once again, and we shared a soft kiss and a forehead kiss — the kind that lingers even after someone walks away. Then she left.
</p>
<p>And I stayed, holding that memory close — of someone who chose to be by my side when I needed it the most.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="timeline-date">16 June 2025 (Where Arguments End And Love Begins.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event"><p>Today was a rollercoaster of emotions – a bit of anger, lots of love, and memories that will stay forever.</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and Shona had a test from 2 PM to 5 PM. We had planned to meet around 6 PM near her bestie house once she got free. After her test, she messaged me. I was already ready and waiting, but she was still having lunch and needed time to get ready.</p>
<p>We ended up having a small argument over text. In frustration, I said, “Let’s not meet,” and she replied with an “Okay, we won’t.” That hit me hard because I was waiting just for her — and now, suddenly, this?</p>
<p>But love has its way. She convinced me, and soon I said, “Okay, let’s meet.” I asked her to message me once she reached her besties house. I left home and reached there a bit early, as always. But she got delayed because her bestie took time to come along.</p>
<p>When we finally met, I asked, “Where do you want to go?” and she replied, “Let’s just leave from here first, we’ll decide on the way.”</p
<p>We hit the road without a fixed plan but ended up deciding on Marodaa Dam. The weather was amazing — strong breezes, cool vibes, and the kind of sky that makes you feel alive. On reaching the dam, we saw that it was already quite crowded. Still, I managed to find us a peaceful little spot to  settle down.</p>
<p>There, we talked… a lot. We held hands, hugged, and laughed. It felt like time paused for us. As we got a little closer, Shona smiled and softly said, “We’re in a public place,” and we both laughed. That little moment meant so much.</p>
<p>After spending some peaceful time there, we decided to leave. While driving aimlessly, she leaned from behind and hugged me tight, holding my hand while I drove with the other. That moment felt like something straight out of a love story — raw, real, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Later, we stopped by a park. I had a bit of an “emergency” moment  (yeah, toilet stuff), and it was a bit embarrassing — but she made even that feel okay.</p>
<p>
After that, we found a more private and quiet place to sit together. There, we shared a kiss — soft, long, and full of emotions. I held her gently, kissed her lips, and felt something deep, something genuine. She kissed me back, all over my face — and I could feel how much love she had in her heart.</p>
<p>We were so connected in those moments —  We kissed again, even tighter, even slower… as if we wanted to freeze time.</p>
<p>
Then we went to her bestie's house, and coincidentally met her bro there. After that, it was time to leave. I gave her a warm hug, kissed her on her forehead, and thanked the universe for giving me this day with her.</p>
<p>And as we were about to leave, it started raining. Maybe the skies were celebrating our love too..</p></div>
