      <div class="timeline-date">03 feb 2025 (A Scribble Turned Memory.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event">Today was our school's Scribble Day. Everything was going normal until something a little unexpected happened. She looked at me and wrote “Jigri” on my shirt. Honestly, I didn’t really understand what it meant at first, but in return, I just wrote my name on her dress.

A little while later, she came to me and asked for a photo together. I didn’t expect it, but I said yes. And just like that, we clicked our first photo together.</div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="timeline-date">06 feb 2025 (Farewell, But Not The End.....)</div>
      <div class="timeline-event"><p>Today was our school farewell. Everything went as expected — laughter, fun, photos, memories. We all enjoyed it a lot. But as the event came to an end, emotions started to take over. Everyone was hugging each other, saying their goodbyes, and getting teary-eyed.</p>

<p>In the middle of all this, my eyes suddenly caught her. Without thinking much, I walked up to her and gave her a hug. It felt... different. I had hugged many people today, but this one just felt special. I don’t know why.</p>

<p>Later, when most of the students had left, a few of us were sitting with the principal. me and her were seated apart at first. Then, out of nowhere, she came and sat right beside me. And in that emotional silence, she held my hand. I didn’t know what was happening.
For a moment, I asked myself — Is this love? But then I told myself, no, it's nothing like that. Still, the feeling was something I can’t really explain. We’ve barely talked before, almost like strangers... and yet, that moment felt so deep and real.</p>

<p>Before leaving, we promised each other that we’d never forget this day — or each other.</p>

<p>Whatever it was... I’m glad it happened.</p></div>
