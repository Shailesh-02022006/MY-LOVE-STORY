Today was our school's Scribble Day. Everything was going normal until something a little unexpected happened. She looked at me and wrote “Jigri” on my shirt. Honestly, I didn’t really understand what it meant at first, but in return, I just wrote my name on her dress.

A little while later, she came to me and asked for a photo together. I didn’t expect it, but I said yes. And just like that, we clicked our first photo together.
